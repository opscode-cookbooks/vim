Description
===========

Installs or compiles/installs vim.

Requirements
============

## Platform:

* Ubuntu/Debian
* Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora/Scientific
* ArchLinux

## Dependencies:

* The compile recipe uses the mercurial cookbook.
* The settings recipe uses the git cookbook.

Attributes
==========

## Default recipe attributes:

* `node['vim']['extra_packages']` - An array of extra packages related to vim to install (like plugins). Empty array by default.

* `node['vim']['install_method']` - Sets the install method, choose from the various install recipes. This attribute is set to 'package' by default.

* `node['vim']['use_custom_settings']` - If set to `true` will download some vim settings. This attribute is set to false by default.


## Compile recipe attributes:

* `node['vim']['compile']['source_path']` - The path were the vim source files will be stored (`/usr/local/src` by default).
* `node['vim']['compile']['source_url']` -  The url for the vim mercurial repository (this should not change any time soon).
* `node['vim']['compile']['dependencies']` - These are the non rhl specific devel dependencies for compiling vim.
* `node['vim']['compile']['centos_dependencies']` - These are the rhl and centos specific depencies needed for compiling vim. 
* `node['vim']['compile']['prefix']` - This is the path the vim bin will be placed, it's `/usr/local` 
* `node['vim']['compile']['configuration']` - If you prefer to compile vim differently than the default you can override this configuration.


## Settings attributes:

* `node['vim']['settings']['source']` - This is the url for the .vim source.
* `node['vim']['settings']['ref']` - This is just a ref in case master is not an option.
* `node['vim']['settings']['dir']` - This is the name of the dir for .vim (in windows it needs to be called vimfiles).
* `node['vim']['settings']['user']` - This is the name of user that we will add this .vim to (it is set to the vagrant user by default).
* `node['vim']['settings']['home']` - This is the path to the home directory of a user.

Usage
=====

Put `recipe[vim]` in a run list, or `include_recipe 'vim'` to ensure that vim is installed on your systems.

If you would like to install additional vim plugin packages, include their package names in the `node['vim']['extra_packages']` attribute. Verify that your operating sytem has the package available.

If you would rather compile vim from source, as the case may be for centos nodes, then override the `node['vim']['compile_from_source']` with a value of `true`.
